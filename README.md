"High levels of conflicting signal in genome-scale coding and non-coding loci support the early rapid cladogenesis hypothesis in Neoaves"


Below, you can find a walkthrough for performed analyses.

# Consensus Noeavian phylogeny

## 1) DNA collection and generation of orthologous sequences

1.a) 

1.b) Running SISRS (Site Identification from Short Read Sequences

SISRS is a software to identify phylogenetically informative sites from next-generation whole-genome sequencing of multiple species. For more detailed information please visit the SISRS repo here: https://github.com/SchwartzLabURI/SISRS/ or see the Methods sectio of Ada et al. 2022 manuscript. Steps are briefly explained below for reproducibility purposes. 

 - First step to succesfully run the SISRS is to make sure that you have a correct directory structure. This can be done with SISRS/scripts/sisrs_01_folder_setup.py script.
