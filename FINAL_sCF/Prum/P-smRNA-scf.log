Host:    n068.cluster.com (AVX512, FMA3, 62 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree-mpi -t ./Reference_Trees/PrumFinalTree.nwk -s Alignments/Biallelic_5Mising_smRNA_NoGaps.phylip-relaxed --scf 100 --prefix P-smRNA-scf
Seed:    510056 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Thu Mar  4 14:56:04 2021
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (36 CPU cores detected)
MPI:     1 processes

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 36 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
